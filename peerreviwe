I saw a couple of minor issues with your implementation of stage 2. When the camera is switch from stage one to stage two, we see that the vessel is on the edge of the camera boundaries. This is a minor issue, but it can be fixed if you add these lines of code " if !current: position = target.position return" anywhere inside your physics process function. Another issue that I encounter was that your vessel natually lags behind, this might be a bug in your code. A way to fix this is by copying what have [in line 30](https://github.com/ensemble-ai/exercise-2-camera-control-Sakidoe/blob/1c0e3dcf88bc09b04b14a0eff2c14a0a4e5dff80/Obscura/scenes/stage_2_camera.gd#L30). Instead of position, you would want to do target.position. Another thing is that your vessel goes out of the camera's boundary. If it is something you want to fix, just use pushBox code as [reference](https://github.com/ensemble-ai/exercise-2-camera-control-Sakidoe/blob/1c0e3dcf88bc09b04b14a0eff2c14a0a4e5dff80/Obscura/scripts/camera_controllers/push_box.gd#L26-L40). The logic remove half the diamenter from the vessel.
